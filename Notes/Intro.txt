CSS(Cascading style sheets): These files are used to design/style the web page
They were introduced in 1994.The current version of CSS is CSS3
There are 3 types of CSS:
  i. inline CSS:
  inline CSS will be applied to any HTML element with 'style'
  as a attribute
  eg:<h1 style="background-color: black; color: white;">Hello Everyone</h1>
  ii. internal CSS:
  internal CSS will be applied to any element or elements with 'style'
  as an element
  <style>
     selector
     {
      //poperties
     }
  </style>
 It is not mandatory to write style element in head, but it will help better performance and SEO
  iii. external CSS:
  external CSS will be applied to any element or any elements as a separate file with '.css' extension
you have to link with 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

inline is the most powerful and between internal and external it depends on the latest one


Basic Selectors:
 1. tag selector:
 tag selectors selects all the elements of that tag name
eg: h1{

}
  2. class name:
  class name is used to select multiple elements with same class name, if we are using classname, it preceeds with dot
  .classname

  3. idname:
  id's are used to select any element uniquely and it preceeds with hash(#)
  #id

if i want to overcome any css priority !important for any property

!important > inline >internal/external(id>class>tag)

i. units
ii. colors
iii. fonts


i. units: units defines the size metrics.
  a.px  --- pixels are the smallest unit of screen but they are not responsive
  b.vh,vw --- viewport height,viewport width-- they are used to assign units according to screen
  c.% -- percentage is used to provide some x % of its parent
  d. em -- enumerated value -- it takes x times of parents font size
  e. rem -- root enumerated value -- it takes always root font size(16px)


2. colors:
